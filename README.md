# Image_only_model
### This version uses new pooling and new dense_ss.
### The new dense_ss is modified by me. (can adjust reuse factor)
### I also compare with Dylan's project to adjust the reuse factor.
### The synthesis time will be a liitle longer. ( 1hour_10mins -> 1hour_50mins )
### The upsamping layer & normalized layer & leaky_relu layer all have been modified.
